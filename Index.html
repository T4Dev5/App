                <h3>History of Minecraft</h3>
                <p>
                    On June 1st, 2009 Markus Persson quits his job at an established games 
developer to create his own game. Unemployed, but enthusiastic, Markus 
was looking for inspiration, and it came from indie game development blog, 
Tigsource. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though Markus' original idea wasn't as fully featured as the Minecraft you'll 
play today, "Cave Game" was created from the same DNA. This was a game 
about placing and breaking blocks in a 3D world. The primary motivation was 
to create an experience where each individual component felt fun. A game 
that could be both accessible and emergent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After years of success, Microsoft officially acquired Mojang (the company Markus 
started) in the fall of 2014 for a reported $2.5 billion.
                </p>
                <p>Today Minecraft is available on the PC, Mac, Xbox, Playstation, PS Vita (~ $27USD).
                    The pocket edition is available on Android and iOS for $6.99.
